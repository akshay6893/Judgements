       "  xxmaj on appeal by the convicts , xxmaj high xxmaj court agreed with the findings of the trial court and dismissed the appeal . xxmaj hence this appeal before us through special leave . \n",
       "  xxmaj at the outset , we would like to mention that in substance it is a case of circumstantial evidence but for the evidence of two chance witnesses , namely xxup pw-4 xxmaj pappu and xxup pw-5 xxmaj surender xxmaj singh . xxup pw-4 xxmaj pappu is a rikshaw puller who is resident of xxmaj sant xxmaj nagar xxmaj jhuggi in xxmaj faridabad . xxup pw-5 xxmaj surender xxmaj singh , a three wheeler driver , is resident of xxmaj railway xxmaj colony , xxmaj old xxmaj faridabad . xxmaj it is relevant to mention here that the incident is said to have occurred near xxmaj air xxmaj force ground . xxmaj it is further relevant to mention that the complainant xxmaj amit xxmaj kumar ( xxup pw-6 ) , his brother xxmaj deepak ( deceased ) and the two accused / appellants are residents of xxup n.i.t. , xxmaj faridabad . xxmaj it is not clear from the record as to how these chance witnesses ( xxup pw-4 xxmaj pappu and xxup pw-5 xxmaj surender xxmaj singh ) who have stated that they heard altercation between the deceased and the two accused after midnight and thereafter heard sound of fire , knew them . xxmaj in our opinion , the testimony of these witnesses can not be said to be reliable or trustworthy particularly when their statements are not corroborated from other evidence on record . \n",
       "  xxmaj now , we come to the report of the xxmaj forensic xxmaj science xxmaj laboratory . xxmaj the conclusions of the examination conducted in the xxmaj forensic xxmaj science xxmaj laboratory , xxmaj haryana , xxmaj madhuban , xxmaj karnal , are reproduced below from xxmaj ex . xxup pf : - \n",

       "  xxrep 14 … ” ( xxmaj emphasis supplied ) xxmaj in view of the conclusions given by xxmaj forensic xxmaj science xxmaj laboratory on points ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , quoted above , we are of the view that the prosecution story , as narrated by xxup pw-4 xxmaj pappu and xxup pw-5 xxmaj surender xxmaj singh , is highly doubtful . \n",
       "  xxmaj apart from this , though the motive of crime is not necessarily required to be proved , but in the case like the present one where the appellants are named on suspicion by informant xxup pw-6 xxmaj amit xxmaj kumar in the xxmaj first xxmaj information xxmaj report ( which does not contain names of xxup pw-4 xxmaj pappu and xxup pw-5 xxmaj surender xxmaj singh as witnesses who had seen the occurrence ) , the motive appears to be relevant fact . xxup pw-6 xxmaj amit xxmaj kumar has simply mentioned that the deceased had asked the two accused to waive of the remaining amount of ? 250 / - from the loan of ? 10,000 / - taken by xxmaj gola but the same does not appear to be a convincing motive to commit the crime by the appellants . xxmaj prosecution has not examined xxmaj gola if he had taken loan of ? 10,000 / - and paid off the same minus the amount ? 250 / - . \n",
       "  xxmaj even otherwise , in the xxmaj first xxmaj information xxmaj report it is nowhere mentioned why actually xxmaj deepak ( deceased ) had gone in his separate scooter with the two appellants from his house . \n",
       "  xxmaj for the reasons , as discussed above , we find that the trial court as well as the xxmaj high xxmaj court has erred in law in holding that the charge against the two accused stood proved . \n",
       "  xxmaj in the light of appreciation of evidence , as above , we are of the opinion that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge of offence punishable under xxmaj section 302 / 34 xxup ipc against the two accused . xxmaj we further hold that the charge of offence punishable under xxmaj section 25 of the xxmaj arms xxmaj act , 1959 against accused xxmaj ajit @ xxmaj dara xxmaj singh is also not proved beyond reasonable doubt . xxmaj accordingly , the appeal deserves to be allowed . \n",
       "  xxmaj the appeal is allowed . xxmaj both the accused , namely xxmaj pawan @ xxmaj rajinder xxmaj singh and xxmaj ajit @ xxmaj dara xxmaj singh , are acquitted of the charges . xxmaj the appellants shall be set at liberty forthwith if not required in connection with any other case . \n",

       "  13 . xxmaj the multi­member body transacts its business after debate , consultation and discussion . xxmaj the view of multi­member body is expressed unanimously or by votes . xxmaj for various kind of decisions by multi­member body special majorities are also provided for acceptance of the decision . xxmaj normally , all decisions of a multi­member body are expressed by opinion of majority of the members present except where the special majorities are provided in the statute itself . \n",
       "  14 . xxmaj shackleton on the “ xxmaj law and xxmaj practice of xxmaj meetings ” , xxmaj eleventh xxmaj edition while discussing the majority has stated 12 following in paragraph 7­30 . xxmaj relevant parts of paragraphs 7­30 and 7­31 are quoted below : \n",
       "  7­30 xxmaj majority is a term signifying the greater number . xxmaj in legislative and deliberative assemblies , it is usual to decide questions by a majority of those present and voting . xxmaj this is sometimes expressed as a “ simple ” majority , which means that a motion is carried by the mere fact that more votes are cast for than against , as distinct from a “ special ” majority where the size of the majority is critical . \n",
       "  xxmaj the principle has long been established that the will of a corporation or body can only be expressed by the whole or a majority of its members , and the act of a majority is regarded as the act of the whole . \n",
       "  a majority vote binds the minority 7­31 xxmaj unless there is some provision to the contrary in the instrument by which a corporation is formed , the resolution of the majority , upon any question , is binding on the majority and the corporation , but the rules must be followed . ” \n",
       "  15 . xxmaj although xxmaj rules , 1994 do not expressly provide that decision of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority shall be taken in accordance with the opinions of the majority but there being no special majority provided for decision to be taken in the meeting of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority , normal , rule that decision by majority of the members present has to be 13 followed . xxmaj in the present case when three members were present and quorum was complete , the decision taken by majority , i.e. , opinion of two members shall form the valid decision of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority . \n",
       " \n",
       "  16 . xxmaj rule 65 sub­section ( 2 ) of the xxmaj rules dealing with the conduct of business of xxmaj transport xxmaj authorities provides : \n",
       "  17 . xxmaj thus , the concept of taking decision by majority of votes of the members is very much present in the scheme of the xxmaj rules . xxmaj although , where a decision is to be taken by the circulation by votes a special majority is provided in xxmaj rule 65(4 ) but present being not a case of decision by circulation , simple majority by members present was sufficient for making a binding decision by the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority . \n",
       "  18 . xxmaj in paragraph 18.1 of the judgment , the xxmaj division xxmaj bench observed that : \n",
       " \n",
       "  19 . xxmaj the above observation was made by the xxmaj division xxmaj bench of the xxmaj high xxmaj court while distinguishing the judgment of this xxmaj court in xxmaj ramaswamy xxmaj nadar v. xxmaj the xxmaj state of xxmaj madras , xxup air 1958 xxup sc 56 . xxmaj before we refer to the decision of this xxmaj court in xxmaj ramaswamy xxmaj nadar , it is clear that observation of the xxmaj division xxmaj bench of the xxmaj high xxmaj court that there is nothing on record to indicate that the quorum of xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority was complete , is factually wrong . xxmaj the order of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority dated 15.12.2014 has been brought on record as xxmaj annexure xxup p­1 and the relevant portion of the order has been extracted above by us which clearly mentions that the hearing took place on 16.10.2014 where the xxmaj chairperson and two members were present the quorum being three as per xxmaj rule 68(1 ) was complete . xxmaj the hearing took place by three members which is noted in the order itself , as extracted above . xxmaj thus , observation of the xxmaj division xxmaj bench of the xxmaj high xxmaj court that quorum was not complete and matter was not heard by three members is not correct . \n",
       "  20 . xxmaj now , we come to the judgment of this xxmaj court in xxmaj ramaswamy xxmaj nadar(supra ) . xxmaj in the above case the matter was heard by a 15 xxmaj bench of three xxmaj judges of this xxmaj court who after hearing had announced the decision of acquittal . xxmaj draft judgment was also approved by one of the xxmaj judges who had , however , died before judgment could be delivered . xxmaj note appended in the judgment was to the following effect : \n",

       "  21 . xxmaj in the above case judgment was pronounced with the concurrence of the three judges . xxmaj when the hearing took place opinion of all the three xxmaj judges was expressed but judgment could be singed by two xxmaj judges since one of the xxmaj judges died . xxmaj although , the facts of the above case was little different i.e. there was material to indicate that the third xxmaj judge who could not sign had also concurred with the opinion , but in the 16 present case there is no pleading of third member whether agreeing or not agreeing with the decision . xxmaj for the present case , we proceed on the premise that the third member did not agree with the decision . xxmaj for the decisions of this xxmaj court , xxmaj article 145 sub­clause ( 5 ) of the xxmaj constitution of xxmaj india provides that judge of this xxmaj court can deliver a judgment with the concurrence of a majority of the xxmaj judges present at the hearing of the case . \n",

       "  22 . xxmaj the present is a case where decision by a multi­member body is to be taken in the meeting of the xxmaj committee as per the statutory xxmaj rules . xxmaj there being no such majority provided for taking a decision , the decision by majority has to be accepted as the opinion of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority . \n",
       "  23 . xxmaj two more cases , which were relied by the appellant and noticed by the xxmaj high xxmaj court need to be noted . xxmaj the xxmaj privy xxmaj council judgment in xxmaj gokal xxmaj xxunk xxmaj jagan xxmaj nath xxmaj vs . xxmaj nand xxmaj ram xxmaj xxunk xxmaj atma xxmaj ram , xxup air ( 1938 ) xxup p.c. 292 , is relevant for the present case . xxmaj in the appeal before the xxmaj privy xxmaj council , judgment of the xxmaj high xxmaj court was assailed on the ground that the two xxmaj hon'ble xxmaj judges of the xxmaj high xxmaj court heard the matter , although , both judges concurred with the judgment , but one xxmaj judge went on leave 17 before signing the judgment , which was signed by only one xxmaj judge . xxmaj the xxmaj privy xxmaj council repelled the contention and held that signing by one of the xxmaj judges at best was only irregularity , not affecting the merits of the case . xxmaj following was laid down in xxmaj paragraphs 6 , 7 and 8:­ “ 6 . a further point was raised by the appellants . xxmaj they urged that the judgment of the xxmaj high xxmaj court appealed from was not a valid judgment because it failed to comply with xxmaj order xxup xli , xxmaj rule 31 , of the xxmaj code of xxmaj civil xxmaj procedure . xxmaj the relevant facts on this issue are that the hearing in the xxmaj high xxmaj court was before two xxmaj judges , xxmaj harrison and xxmaj agha xxmaj haider xxup jj . , and was actually delivered by the former xxmaj judge , the latter agreeing . xxmaj the judgment was delivered on xxmaj february 22 , 1933 . xxmaj but xxmaj harrison xxup j. went on leave before signing the judgment , which was signed by xxmaj agha xxmaj haider xxup j. , the xxmaj deputy xxmaj registrar appending a note that xxmaj harrison xxup j. had gone on leave before signing the judgment he delivered . \n",
       "  7 . xxmaj order xxup xli , xxmaj rule 31 requires that the judgment of the appellate xxmaj court shall be in writing and shall state various matters , and \" shall at the time that it is pronounced be signed and dated by the xxmaj judge or by the xxmaj judges concurring therein . \" \n",
       "  8 . xxmaj the xxmaj rule does not say that if its requirements are not complied with the judgment shall be a nullity . xxmaj so startling a result would need clear and precise words . xxmaj indeed the xxmaj rule does not even state any definite time in which it is to be fulfilled . xxmaj the time is left to be defined by what is reasonable . xxmaj the xxmaj rule from its very nature is not intended to affect the rights of parties to a judgment . xxmaj it is intended to secure certainty in the ascertainment of what the 18 judgment was . xxmaj it is a rule which xxmaj judges are required to comply with for that object . xxmaj no doubt in practice xxmaj judges do so comply , as it is their duty to do . xxmaj but accidents may happen . a xxmaj judge may die after giving judgment but before he has had a reasonable opportunity to sign it . xxmaj the xxmaj court must have inherent jurisdiction to supply such a defect . xxmaj the case of a xxmaj judge who has gone on leave before signing the judgment may call for more comment , but even so the convenience of the xxmaj court and the interest of litigants must prevail . xxmaj the defect is merely an irregularity . xxmaj but in truth the difficulty is disposed of by xxmaj sections 99 and 108 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj procedure xxmaj code . xxmaj section 99 provides that no decree shall be reversed or substantially varied nor shall any case be remanded , in appeal on account of any error , defect or irregularity in any proceedings in the suit , not affecting the merits of the case or the jurisdiction of the xxmaj court . xxmaj that xxmaj section xxunk in the part dealing with appeals from original decrees . xxmaj but xxmaj section 108 applies the same provision to appeals from appellate decrees and it is always in the discretion of the xxmaj board to apply the principle on appeal to xxmaj his xxmaj majesty in xxmaj council . xxmaj in their xxmaj lordships ' judgment , the defect here was an irregularity not affecting the merits of the case or the jurisdiction of the xxmaj court , and is no ground for setting aside the decree . ” \n",
       "  24 . xxmaj another judgment , which was cited by the appellant was xxup a. xxmaj shanta xxmaj rao xxmaj vs . xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj appellate xxmaj tribunal , xxmaj hyderabad & xxmaj ors . , xxup air 1985 xxup a.p. 256 . xxmaj in the above case , xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj appellate xxmaj tribunal consisting of xxmaj chairman and two members heard the matter . xxmaj however , the order was issued only with the signature of xxmaj chairman . xxmaj the order was attacked on the ground 19 that the other two members having not signed the order , the order is illegal . xxmaj repelling the contention following was stated in xxmaj paragraph xxunk “ 9 . xxmaj on the first question , i am of the view that once the minutes of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority are found to be signed by all the members including the xxmaj chairman , the mere fact that the final order is communicated under the signature of the xxmaj chairman alone does not amount to any illegality . xxmaj the xxmaj court has to see the substance of the matter and not the mere form , and if it is clear that all the members of the xxmaj tribunal have applied their mind to the facts of the case and arrived at a conclusion , it does not matter if the communication is made under the signature of the xxmaj chairman . ” \n",
       "  25 . xxmaj although , in above two cases , there was concurrence of all the members of xxmaj court / xxmaj tribunal but all had not signed the order . xxmaj the present is a case where xxmaj chairperson and two members heard the application in meeting dated 16.10.2014 but order was subsequently pronounced on 15.12.2014 and signed by only xxmaj chairperson and one member . xxmaj the third member having been transferred in the meanwhile . xxmaj as noticed above , there is no pleading in the writ petition as to whether the third member , who was transferred had agreed with the proposed order or did not agree with the decision , which was to be delivered by the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority . xxmaj had third member agreed , there can not be any debate in this matter , the issues being covered 20 by judgment of this xxmaj court in xxmaj ramaswamy xxmaj nadar(supra ) and judgment of the xxmaj privy xxmaj council in xxmaj gokal xxmaj chand xxunk xxmaj nath ( supra ) . xxmaj but there being neither any pleading nor any material to come to the conclusion that the third member has agreed with the opinion , we have proceeded to examine the present case as if , the third member did not agree with the order proposed . xxmaj we have already noticed the reason for coming to the conclusion that the order issued by the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority , signed by the xxmaj chairperson and one member is a valid order having been issued with the majority opinion of two out of three , who heard the application on 16.10.2014 . xxmaj thus , in any view of the matter , no illegality can be attached with the order dated 15.12.2014 , which was signed by the xxmaj chairperson and one member . \n",
       " \n",
       "  26 . xxmaj in view of the foregoing discussion , we are of the opinion that decision dated 15.12.2014 issued with the signatures of xxmaj chairperson and one member was a valid decision in spite of the fact that one of the members who was present in the hearing when the meeting took place on 16.10.2014 and had been transferred in the meanwhile did not sign the order . xxmaj the decision of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority dated 15.12.2014 was fully in accordance with the statutory scheme of the xxmaj rules , 1994 and both the learned xxmaj single xxmaj judge and xxmaj division 21 xxmaj bench erred in holding the decision as invalid . xxmaj we , thus , are of the view that judgments of learned xxmaj single xxmaj judge and xxmaj division xxmaj bench do not express the correct view of the law . \n",

' xxmaj time xxmaj charters world over are considered a contract of service . xxmaj there is a difference between the ‘ right to use goods ’ and ‘ the transfer of the right to use goods . ’ xxmaj in case of a lease , there is a transfer of an interest in the property , whereas , in a licence , there is a mere right to use the property . xxmaj the xxmaj time xxmaj charter is recognised as an agreement in the nature of pure service . xxmaj they are entirely distinct from xxmaj bareboat xxmaj charter xxmaj agreement or charter by demise . xxmaj the charters are of three kinds viz . ( a ) xxmaj time 4 xxmaj charter , ( b ) xxmaj bareboat xxmaj charter or xxmaj charter by xxmaj demise , and ( c ) xxmaj voyage xxmaj charter . xxmaj time charter and voyage charter are contracts of service , whereas bareboat charter amounts to transfer of right to use the ship itself . xxmaj in a time charter , master and crew are in the employment of the owner , and complete control , ownership , and possession of the vessel remain only with the owner through the master and crew . xxmaj the delivery to the xxmaj port xxmaj trust is only a symbolic one , and the legal and physical possession of xxmaj tug continues to be with the company . xxmaj thus , the arrangement is a service , not a lease . xxmaj learned senior counsel has made reference to xxmaj scrutton on charter parties , xxmaj halsbury 's xxmaj laws of xxmaj england , and have also relied upon various decisions . \n",

       "  11 . xxmaj mr. xxmaj datar has further submitted that under xxmaj entries 56 and 57 of xxmaj list xxup ii , the xxmaj state legislature has the competence to levy tax on the carriage of goods and passengers only on inland waters base . xxmaj by implication , any taxes on the carriage of goods or passengers in the territorial waters is outside the legislative competence of the xxmaj state 8 legislature . xxmaj entries 25 to 27 of xxmaj list i indicate that the entire shipping industry is exclusively within the domain of xxmaj parliament . xxmaj entry 27 of list­i cover the ports , and the agreement is with the xxmaj port xxmaj trust . xxmaj he has further attracted our attention to section 5 of the xxmaj territorial xxmaj waters xxmaj act , 1976 . xxmaj section 5 defines the contiguous zone to be at a distance of 24 nautical miles from the nearest point of the xxunk . xxmaj the xxmaj central xxmaj government has the exclusive power to make laws concerning customs and other fiscal matters on activities that take place in the contiguous zone . xxmaj the xxmaj territorial xxmaj waters xxmaj act prevails over the xxmaj state legislature dealing with sales tax , i.e. , the xxup kst xxmaj act . xxmaj thus , the decision in 20th xxmaj century xxmaj finance xxmaj corporation xxmaj ltd. v. xxmaj state of xxmaj maharashtra , 2000 ( 6 ) xxup scc 12 is not attracted in which this xxmaj court was concerned with the controversy as to which xxmaj state could levy sales tax , where signing of the contract , delivery of the goods or use of the rights were in different xxmaj states . xxmaj the majority held that the xxmaj state where a contract is signed would have the power to levy a sales tax . xxmaj thus , the place where the goods were delivered or used could not be a ground for levy of sales tax . xxmaj merely signing of the contract in xxmaj mangalore conferred no jurisdiction to levy sales­tax on the xxmaj state of xxmaj karnataka . xxmaj the decision has no application to the transaction , the effect of which takes place in territorial waters or the high seas , even if the agreement is signed within a particular xxmaj state . 9 \n",
       "  12 . xxmaj mr. xxmaj mohan xxmaj parasaran , learned senior counsel has taken us in detail to various clauses of the agreement . xxmaj the agreement is in the nature of a time charter as approved by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj produce xxmaj exchange ( xxup xxunk ) , which is the standard form for time charters . xxmaj it is neither a bareboat cum demise charter nor a voyage charter and is , therefore , only a time charter because of terms and conditions . xxmaj he has relied upon xxup bsnl v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india , ( 2006 ) 3 xxup scc 1 wherein this xxmaj court has laid down essential attributes of a transaction to constitute a transfer of the right to use the goods . xxmaj at no point of time , the vessel should go out of the possession or control of the company , therefore the essential ingredient to constitute it a transfer of the right to use is missing . xxmaj he has also referred to xxup dlf xxmaj universal xxmaj ltd. v. xxmaj director , xxmaj town and xxmaj country xxmaj planning xxmaj department , xxmaj haryana , ( 2010 ) 14 xxup scc 1 . xxmaj the very language of the agreement makes it clear to be a contract of service . xxmaj the expressions like delivery and re­delivery are not to be understood in a literal sense . xxmaj there are certain obligations upon the company , which makes out that effective control over the vessel is with the company . xxmaj he had also referred to xxmaj harbour xxmaj craft xxmaj rules . xxmaj the tug is always operated , controlled , run , maintained , and insured by the company . xxmaj possession of the xxmaj tug remains with it . xxmaj in the event the tug is disabled from use , the charterer is not required to pay xxunk 10 party charges to the company . xxmaj the company has to indemnify the charterer . \n",

       "  33 . xxmaj eventually , the xxmaj court analyzing the test of xxmaj article 14 , opined:­ “ xxmaj in our opinion , the wide sweep of xxmaj article 14 undoubtedly takes within its fold the impugned circular issued by the xxmaj state of xxup u.p. in exercise of its executive power , irrespective of the precise nature of appointment of the xxmaj government xxmaj counsel in the districts and the other rights , contractual or statutory , which the appointees may have . xxmaj it is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground 42 that independent of any statutory right , available to the appointees , and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment , the impugned circular , issued in exercise of the executive power of the xxmaj state , must satisfy xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary , it must be struck down . xxmaj however , we have referred to certain provisions relating to initial appointment , termination or renewal of tenure to indicate that the action is controlled at least by settled guidelines , followed by the xxmaj state of xxup u.p. , for a long time . xxmaj this too is relevant for deciding the question of arbitrariness alleged in the present case . ” xxmaj the aforesaid passages clearly show that the xxmaj court went by the concept of public element attached to the office or post of xxmaj government xxmaj pleader . xxmaj it has not expressed the opinion that they are under the xxmaj government service . xxmaj be that as it may , as has been held by the learned xxmaj single xxmaj judge and rightly so , there is no xxunk relationship and the respondent was not amenable to any disciplinary proceeding . xxmaj he has correctly expressed the view that the conduct of the advocate is subject to the discipline of the xxmaj bar xxmaj council . xxmaj as we notice , there is nothing on record to show that he was getting any remuneration . xxmaj even if some remuneration is attached to the 43 office , he can not be treated to be under the service of the xxmaj state xxmaj government . xxmaj the aspects which are essential for establishing a relationship of master and servant are absent . xxmaj therefore , the returned candidate could not have been treated to be in service under the xxmaj state xxmaj government . \n",

       "  36 . xxmaj the controversy in this regard has arisen in view of what is stated in paragraph 82 of the decision in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation . xxmaj it was stated as follows : xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 27 of 101 “ xxmaj as we have held that the deemed mining leases of the lessees in xxmaj goa expired on 22 - 11 - 1987 and the maximum period ( 20 years ) of renewal of the deemed mining leases in xxmaj goa has also expired on 22- 11 - 2007 , mining by the lessees in xxmaj goa after 22 - 11 - 2007 was illegal . xxmaj hence , the xxmaj order dated 10 - 9 - 2012 of the xxmaj government of xxmaj goa suspending mining operations in the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa and the xxmaj order dated 14 - 9 - 2012 of moef , xxmaj government of xxmaj india , suspending the environmental clearances granted to the mines in the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa , which have been impugned in the writ petitions in the xxmaj bombay xxmaj high xxmaj court , xxmaj goa xxmaj bench ( transferred to this xxmaj court and registered as transferred cases ) can not be quashed by this xxmaj court . xxmaj the xxmaj order dated xxunk of the xxmaj government of xxmaj goa and the xxmaj order dated 14.9.2012 of the moef will have to continue till decisions are taken by the xxmaj state xxmaj government to grant fresh leases and decisions are taken by moef to grant fresh environmental clearances for mining projects . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] . \n",
       "  37 . xxmaj the issue that arose for discussion before us was the meaning and intention of the xxmaj court in the context of grant of „ fresh xxunk for mining projects . xxmaj did the xxmaj court literally mean that a fresh mining lease was required to be granted or was a second renewal sufficient compliance ? \n",
       "  38 . xxmaj as the above quoted paragraph indicates , the xxmaj court was aware and conscious of the fact that the mining leases had expired on 22nd xxmaj november , 2007 and the mining operations thereafter carried out by the mining lease holders was illegal . xxmaj for this reason , the xxmaj court held that the suspension order passed by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa on 10th xxmaj september , 2012 and the abeyance order passed by the moef on 14th xxmaj september , 2012 did not require any interference . \n",

       "  39 . xxmaj since the mining operations carried out after 22nd xxmaj november , 2007 were illegal , the xxmaj court , in subsequent paragraphs of the judgment noted ( as a follow up ) that an order was passed on 5th xxmaj october , 2012 suspending transportation of iron ore and manganese ore from those leases identified by the xxmaj justice xxmaj shah xxmaj xxunk xxmaj thereafter on 11th xxmaj november , 2013 it was directed that an inventory be made of the excavated mineral ores and the xxunk mineral ores be sold by e - auction under the supervision of a xxmaj monitoring xxmaj xxunk \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj it was then directed by the xxmaj court in paragraph xxunk of the xxmaj report as follows : \n",
       "  41 . xxmaj the xxmaj court was quite obviously aware that it was concerned , inter alia , with the second renewal of mining leases and yet it chose to recount the factual situation , make a declaration and pass a direction without adverting to the possibility of a second renewal of a mining lease . xxmaj the xxmaj court was also conscious that the mining lease holders had carried out indiscriminate and illegal mining for about five years ( from xxmaj november 2007 to xxmaj september 2012 ) and had made profits out of the illegal mining . xxmaj the xxmaj court , in our opinion , was rather charitable in not penalizing the mining lease holders for the illegal mining carried out by them . xxmaj but be that as it may , quite clearly , the sequence of events from xxmaj september 2012 onwards , the appointment of a xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 30 of 101 xxmaj monitoring xxmaj committee to dispose of the illegally mined ore , the declaration and direction unmistakably point to the intention of the xxmaj court to end the sordid chapter of illegal mining by the lease holders and start on a clean slate . xxmaj viewed in this perspective , we have no doubt that the xxmaj court really did intend the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to consider the grant of fresh leases in accordance with law . \n",
       "  42 . xxmaj in this context , the declaration of the xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation in paragraph 87.5 of xxmaj report is also quite clear , namely , “ xxmaj it is for the xxmaj state xxmaj government to decide as a matter of policy in what manner mining leases are to be granted in future … . ” xxmaj the declaration was explicit and related to the grant of mining leases and not a second renewal . \n",
       "  43 . xxmaj similarly , the direction given in paragraph xxunk of the xxmaj report that “ xxmaj the xxmaj state xxmaj government may grant mining leases of iron ore and other ores in xxmaj goa in accordance with its policy decision … .. ” was equally explicit and related to the grant of mining leases and not a second renewal . \n",
       "  44 . xxmaj subsequent events confirm our impression and view . xxmaj the decision of the xxmaj court to e - auction the mined mineral ore was sought to be recalled through xxup i.a. xxmaj no . 86 of 2014 filed by m / s xxmaj xxunk xxmaj brothers xxmaj private xxmaj ltd. xxmaj the applicant prayed for a direction to restrain the authorities from e- auctioning the iron ore mined by it prior to 22nd xxmaj november , 2007 and that xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 31 of 101 the mined ore should be released to the applicant with the right to dispose of the same . a xxmaj bench of three learned judges ( other than those that decided xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation ) noted that : “ xxmaj the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant were premised merely on the assertion , that the mineral ore which the applicant was claiming a right over , had been legitimately mined before xxunk , and therefore , the applicant had an absolute and legitimate ownership over the same . xxmaj we may note , that the above position was emphasized , stressed and persistently reiterated to make the stand absolutely crystal clear . ” xxmaj the learned judges considered the submissions and held by an order dated 14th xxmaj october , 2014 that the direction in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation was clear and categorical that the iron ore vested in the xxmaj state xxmaj government and therefore the application deserved dismissal . xxmaj in other words , the mining lease holders deserved no latitude for the illegal mining and all issues needed to be dealt with strictly . \n",
       "  45 . xxmaj there is additional material to support the view that the xxmaj court had intended the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant fresh mining leases rather than grant a second renewal . \n",
       "  46 . xxmaj from a reading of the decision rendered by the xxmaj bombay xxmaj high xxmaj court in xxmaj lithoferro ( subject matter of xxup slp ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 and xxup slp ( c ) xxmaj nos . 32699 - 32727 of 2015 ) it is evident that the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa understood the xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 32 of 101 decision of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation to mean that fresh mining leases were required to be granted on the basis of a policy yet to be framed by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa and the issue of second renewals did not survive consideration . xxmaj the contention of the learned xxmaj advocate xxmaj general of the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa in this regard is recorded by the xxmaj high xxmaj court in the following words : \n",
       "  47 . xxmaj while considering the submissions of the learned xxmaj advocate xxmaj general and learned counsel , the xxmaj high xxmaj court noted that this xxmaj court was alive to the xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 33 of 101 fact that the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa had granted in - principle second renewal to 28 mining leases and had collected renewal fees or stamp duty from 27 mining leases ( presumably out of the 28 mining leases ) as stated in the brief resume filed by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa in this xxmaj court . xxmaj the xxmaj high xxmaj court noted : \n",
       "  48 . xxmaj in other words , notwithstanding the in - principle grant of second renewal of 28 mining leases and collection of renewal fees or stamp duty , this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation consciously required the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant fresh leases . xxmaj what is equally significant is that the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa also understood the decision of the xxmaj court in the same manner and intended to act on that basis . \n",
       "  49 . xxmaj unfortunately , the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa was overtaken by events in that the xxmaj high xxmaj court delivered its judgment in xxmaj lithoferro on 13th xxmaj august , 2014 and while doing so , it misunderstood or incorrectly appreciated the decision of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation and disagreed with the view of the xxmaj state of xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 34 of 101 xxmaj goa . xxmaj while this xxmaj court had required the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant fresh mining leases and the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa was willing to comply with this direction , the xxmaj high xxmaj court instead directed it to execute mining leases under xxmaj section 8(3 ) of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act in respect of those who had paid the renewal fees or stamp duty . xxmaj the xxmaj high xxmaj court also directed the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to decide their pending second renewal applications within a period of three months keeping in mind the provisions of xxmaj section 8(3 ) of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act ( presumably after paying the renewal fees or stamp duty in terms of the xxmaj government order of 21 st xxmaj february , 2013 ) . xxmaj the understanding by the xxmaj high xxmaj court of the decision of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation is totally incorrect . \n",
       "  50 . xxmaj it appears from the contents of the xxmaj grant of xxmaj mining xxmaj leases xxmaj policy that in view of the decision of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation the xxmaj state was actively considering a policy for granting fresh mining leases by considering several factors . xxmaj however , the decision and directions of the xxmaj high xxmaj court xxunk leaving no choice , according to the xxmaj state , but to completely abandon the process of grant of fresh mining leases through the process of competitive bidding for earning revenue and justify the abandonment . \n",
       "  51 . xxmaj as per the xxmaj grant of xxmaj mining xxmaj leases xxmaj policy , the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa therefore had two realistic options before it : ( i ) xxmaj to implement the judgment and order of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation ( as understood by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa ) and xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 35 of 101 grant fresh mining leases in the manner felt appropriate and in accordance with law ; ( ii ) xxmaj to abide by the judgment of the xxmaj high xxmaj court ( and its understanding of the judgment of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation while rejecting its understanding by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa ) and grant second renewal to the mining leases in terms of xxmaj section 8(3 ) of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act . xxmaj the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa appears to have taken the view that challenging the decision of the xxmaj high xxmaj court ( and therefore abiding by the decision of this xxmaj court ) would delay the commencement of mining operations . xxmaj the xxmaj state took into consideration that a substantial portion of its revenue comes from the mining sector and that the xxmaj state had been virtually starved of funds on account of stoppage of mining operations . xxmaj therefore , the xxmaj state decided to grant a second renewal to the mining leases and not grant fresh leases . xxmaj this is quite apparent from the contents of the xxmaj grant of xxmaj mining xxmaj leases xxmaj policy wherein the above facts and conclusions have been stated in greater detail . xxmaj was this decision correct ? \n",
       "  52 . xxmaj learned counsel for the mining lease holders submitted that the renewal of a mining lease is equivalent to or amounts to the grant of a fresh lease and therefore when the mining leases were renewed , it amounted to the grant of a fresh lease in compliance with the directions of this xxmaj court . xxmaj reliance was placed upon xxmaj delhi xxmaj development xxmaj authority v. xxmaj durga xxmaj chand xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 36 of 101 xxmaj xxunk wherein this xxmaj court held : \n",
       "  ( 1973 ) 2 xxup scc 825 12 1989 xxmaj supp ( 1 ) xxup scc 487 13 ( 2004 ) 12 xxup scc 118 14 ( 2015 ) 8 xxup scc 655 15 ( 1997 ) 1 xxup scc 650 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 37 of 101 \n",
       "  55 . xxmaj there is no doubt that the renewal of a lease is virtually the same as the grant of a fresh lease but a converse direction to grant a mining lease can not be understood to mean granting a renewal of a mining lease . xxmaj obviously , the grant of a fresh lease is not the same as the renewal of a lease and when the xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation required the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant a fresh lease , it did not require the xxmaj state to renew the existing ( expired ) lease . xxmaj the xxmaj court could have explicitly declared and directed the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant a second renewal of the mining leases rather than to say it in a xxunk manner that it should do so by granting a fresh lease equivalent to a renewal . xxmaj we simply can not accept the submissions made by learned counsel for the mining lease holders in this regard . \n",
       "  56 . xxmaj that apart , as we have already noted above , the context and material on record xxunk the thought that the xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation did not mandate the grant of fresh mining leases in accordance with law . \n",
       "  57 . xxmaj learned counsel for the mining lease holders contended that the very same learned judges that decided xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation permitted the xxmaj state xxmaj government in xxmaj common xxmaj cause v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india16 to consider granting a second renewal of mining leases under xxmaj section 8(3 ) of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act . xxmaj therefore the requirement in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation for the grant of „ fresh xxunk 16 ( 2014 ) 14 xxup scc 155 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 38 of 101 must be understood in a manner similar to what was directed in xxmaj common xxmaj cause . xxmaj we are unable to accept this contention . xxmaj the direction given in xxmaj common xxmaj cause was an interim direction and not a final direction as in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation . xxmaj moreover , the facts in both cases are not at all similar so as to warrant a similar order being passed or understood . xxmaj finally , the fact that the same set of learned judges thought it fit to direct the grant of „ fresh xxunk in one set of cases and thought it fit to direct consideration of a „ second xxunk in another set of cases indicates that the learned judges were aware of the difference in directions . xxmaj therefore when the leaned judges directed the grant of „ fresh xxunk in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation it was a deliberate and conscious decision distinct and different from granting a second renewal of expired mining leases . \n",
       "  58 . xxmaj in our opinion , the direction in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation is quite clear and instead of considering the grant of a second renewal of the mining leases , the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa was required to consider the grant of fresh mining leases . xxmaj therefore the decision of the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant a second renewal of the mining leases is erroneous , contrary to the decision in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation and must be and is quashed . \n",
       "  xxmaj whether the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa should have auctioned the mining leases ? \n",
       "  59 . xxmaj as mentioned in the xxmaj grant of xxmaj mining xxmaj leases xxmaj policy there were several xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 39 of 101 options available to the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa . xxmaj it took the view that all its options were foreclosed post the decision of the xxmaj high xxmaj court and it was obliged to grant a second renewal of the mining leases . xxmaj we have already held that this was not so and that the decision to grant a second renewal of the mining leases was erroneous and fresh leases were required to be granted in accordance with the decision in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation . xxmaj in view of our conclusion , the discussion on whether the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa should have auctioned the mining leases through a process of competitive bidding is now rendered academic . xxmaj however , since detailed submissions were made by learned counsel on both sides , including by the learned xxmaj additional xxmaj solicitor xxmaj general , we propose to express our views on the subject . \n",
       "  60 . xxmaj the discussion on the question of auction being the only method of allocation or disposal of natural resources arose due to the view expressed by this xxmaj court in xxmaj centre for xxmaj public xxmaj interest xxmaj litigation v. xxmaj union of xxmaj xxunk xxmaj in that decision ( hereafter referred to as xxup cpil – although this case is generally referred to as the 2 g scam case ) the xxmaj court dealt with the question of following a non - discriminatory policy for alienation of natural resources . xxmaj while doing so it was observed that an auction is “ perhaps the best method for discharging this burden ” and concluded by holding that “ while 17 ( 2012 ) 3 xxup scc 1 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 40 of 101 transferring or alienating the natural resources , the xxmaj state is duty - bound to adopt the method of auction by giving wide publicity so that all eligible persons can participate in the process . ” xxmaj this led to the belief that the view of this xxmaj court was that natural resources should be alienated or disposed of only by auction and by no other method . xxmaj the xxmaj court held in paragraphs 95 and 96 of the xxmaj report as follows : \n",
       "  61 . xxmaj in xxmaj manohar xxmaj lal xxmaj sharma v. xxmaj principal xxmaj xxunk a xxmaj bench of 3 judges of this xxmaj court paraphrased the above passages and observed that the view 18 ( 2014 ) 9 xxup scc 516 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 41 of 101 expressed in xxup cpil necessitated a reference by the xxmaj president of xxmaj india to this xxmaj court under xxmaj article 143(1 ) of the xxmaj constitution being xxmaj special xxmaj reference xxmaj no . 1 – xxmaj natural xxmaj resources xxmaj xxunk \n",
       "  62 . xxmaj what was the xxmaj advisory xxmaj opinion given by this xxmaj court in xxmaj natural xxmaj resources xxmaj allocation ? xxmaj among the questions referred for opinion were the following : \n",
       "  63 . xxmaj in the xxmaj reference , it was submitted before the xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench that paragraphs 94 to 96 in xxup cpil laid down the ratio vis - à - vis disposal of natural resources . xxmaj it was argued that “ these paragraphs lay down , as a proposition of law , that all natural resources across all sectors , and in all circumstances are to be disposed of by way of public auction , and on the other [ hand ] , it was urged that the observations therein were made only qua spectrum . ” \n",
       "  64 . xxmaj the submissions made by learned counsel were then discussed and thereafter this xxmaj court recorded its conclusions between paragraphs 82 and 84 of xxmaj natural xxmaj resources xxmaj allocation . xxmaj in paragraph 84 , it was held : 19 ( 2012 ) 10 xxup scc 1 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 42 of 101 “ 84 . xxmaj thus , having come to the conclusion that 2 g case20 does not deal with modes of allocation for natural resources , other than spectrum , we shall now proceed to answer the first question of the xxmaj reference pertaining to other natural resources , as the question subsumes the essence of the entire reference , particularly the set of first five questions . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] . \n",
       " \n",
       "  65 . xxmaj thereafter , while answering the first question in the xxmaj reference , the xxmaj court considered the issue from various perspectives . xxmaj it first dealt with the issue in the context of xxmaj article 14 and xxmaj article 39(b ) of the xxmaj constitution and concluded in paragraph 120 of the xxmaj report that the disposal of natural resources for revenue maximization through auctions is not a constitutional mandate . xxmaj it was held : \n",
       "  66 . xxmaj the issue was then considered from the standpoint of legitimate deviations from an auction . xxmaj after adverting to several decisions of this xxmaj court 20 xxmaj centre for xxmaj public xxmaj interest xxmaj litigation v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india ( xxup cpil case or 2 g scam case ) xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 43 of 101 where auctions were not the favoured method of allocation of natural resources , it was held between paragraphs 129 and 131 of the xxmaj report as follows : \n",
       "  ( 1980 ) 4 xxup scc 1 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 44 of 101 \n",
       "  67 . xxmaj finally , the issue was considered from the point of view of the potential of abuse in allocation of natural resources other than through auction and in this context it was held in paragraph 135 of the xxmaj report : \n",
       "  68 . xxmaj the conclusion arrived at by the xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench was then recorded between paragraphs 148 and 150 of the xxmaj report in the following words : \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj regard being had to the aforesaid precepts , we have opined that auction as a mode can not be conferred the status of a constitutional xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 45 of 101 principle . xxmaj alienation of natural resources is a policy decision , and the means adopted for the same are thus , executive prerogatives . xxmaj however , when such a policy decision is not backed by a social or welfare purpose , and precious and scarce natural resources are alienated for commercial pursuits of profit maximising private entrepreneurs , adoption of means other than those that are competitive and maximise revenue may be arbitrary and face the wrath of xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution . xxmaj hence , rather than prescribing or proscribing a method , we believe , a judicial scrutiny of methods of disposal of natural resources should depend on the facts and circumstances of each case , in consonance with the principles which we have culled out above . xxmaj failing which , the xxmaj court , in exercise of power of judicial review , shall term the executive action as arbitrary , unfair , unreasonable and capricious due to its antimony with xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution . \n",
       "  xxmaj in conclusion , our answer to the first set of five questions is that auctions are not the only permissible method for disposal of all natural resources across all sectors and in all circumstances . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] . \n",
       " \n",
       "  69 . xxmaj it is therefore more than explicit that there is no constitutional requirement ( let alone a mandate ) for allocation of natural resources through the auction method ( other than spectrum ) but at the same time the auction process should not be given a go - bye without any justification – the decision to give a go - bye is judicially reviewable though the scope of judicial review might be rather restricted . xxmaj the melting pot of allocation of a natural resource , a social or welfare purpose and adherence to the requirements of xxmaj articles 14 and 39(b ) of the xxmaj constitution in matters of policy was a great leap forward fashioned by the xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench . xxmaj consequently , while xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 46 of 101 there is no mandate , constitutional or otherwise , that natural resource allocation must be only by auction , it is certainly “ a more preferable method ” . xxmaj there are exceptions , such as when the natural resource allocation is for a “ social or welfare purpose ” . xxmaj on the other hand if the natural resource allocation is “ for commercial pursuits of profit maximising private entrepreneurs ” de hors any social or welfare purpose , then judicial review would be permissible and xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution would be attracted and if the executive action is found to be arbitrary , it would be struck down . xxmaj therefore , when it comes to natural resource allocation , the executive has a somewhat limited elbow room . \n",
       "  70 . xxmaj in his concurring opinion , xxmaj justice xxmaj khehar took the view ( in paragraph 186 of the xxmaj report ) that : “ … when natural resources are made available by the xxmaj state to private persons for commercial exploitation exclusively for their individual gains , the xxmaj state 's endeavour must be towards maximisation of revenue returns . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] xxmaj the learned judge concluded his opinion by agreeing that an auction is one of the price recovery mechanisms , but not the only one for allocation of natural resources . “ xxmaj that should not be understood to mean that it can never be a valid method for disposal of natural resources . ” xxmaj it was further held that natural resources can not be alienated by way of largesse – there must be a reciprocal xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 47 of 101 consideration either in the form of earning revenue or sub - serving the common good or both . xxmaj the learned judge had this to say : \n",
       "  71 . xxmaj this issue was considered in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation as well . xxmaj the xxmaj court adverted to xxmaj natural xxmaj resources xxmaj allocation in paragraph 81 of the xxmaj report and pithily expressed its view that the manner of granting a mining lease is a policy decision of the xxmaj state xxmaj government , but the decision can be examined by way of judicial review . xxmaj it was held : \n",
       "  xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 48 of 101 “ xxmaj we are of the considered opinion that it is for the xxmaj state xxmaj government to decide as a matter of policy in what manner the leases of these mineral resources would be granted , but this decision has to be taken in accordance with the provisions of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act and the xxmaj rules made thereunder and in consonance with the constitutional provisions and the decision taken by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant a mining lease in a particular manner or to a particular party can be examined by way of judicial review by the xxmaj court . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] . \n",
       "  xxmaj it was then declared in paragraph 87.5 of the xxmaj report that : \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj similarly , in xxmaj manohar xxmaj lal xxmaj sharma this xxmaj court adverted to the issue and noted the following in paragraph 98 of the xxmaj report : \n",
       " \n",
       "  74 . xxmaj till fairly recently , policy matters particularly of economic policy were hands - off as far as the courts were xxunk xxmaj but the recent decisions of this xxmaj court , including by the xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench in its advisory jurisdiction , have partially modified this theory and kept open the window to judicially review such a policy if it does not serve the common good as understood in xxmaj article 39(b ) of the xxmaj constitution , if it violates xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution and xxunk natural resources for maximizing profits of private entrepreneurs while xxunk xxmaj article 39(b ) of the xxmaj constitution . “ xxmaj the legislature and the executive are answerable to the xxmaj constitution and it is there where the judiciary , the guardian of the xxmaj constitution , must find the contours to the powers of disposal of natural resources , especially xxmaj article 14 and xxmaj article 39(b ) [ of the xxmaj xxunk \n",
       "  75 . xxmaj notwithstanding this , a xxmaj court must exercise restraint and not set aside xxmaj government policy only because it disagrees with it or because a better policy could be framed or simply because it has the power to set aside the policy . xxmaj policies framed by the xxmaj state , after due consideration , must be 24 xxup balco xxmaj employees ’ xxmaj union ( xxmaj regd ) v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india , ( 2002 ) 2 xxup scc 333 at paragraphs 46 and 47 25 xxmaj paragraph 95 of the xxmaj natural xxmaj resource xxmaj allocation decision xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 52 of 101 respected and given enough elbow room and flexibility for implementation . xxmaj of course , there would be occasions when the implementation of a policy has teething problems or some lacuna is discovered at a slightly later stage , but that does not mean that policy itself is defective . xxmaj therefore , xxmaj courts must be very cautious and circumspect in diluting or setting aside a policy and must do so only if it is constitutionally unavoidable , otherwise good governance could be a casualty . \n",
       " \n",
       "  76 . xxmaj the conclusions that could be drawn from all these decisions are : ( i ) xxmaj it is not obligatory , constitutionally or otherwise , that a natural resource ( other than spectrum ) must be disposed of or alienated or allocated only through an auction or through competitive bidding ; ( ii ) xxmaj where xxeos\n",

       "  21 . xxmaj in the above case judgment was pronounced with the concurrence of the three judges . xxmaj when the hearing took place opinion of all the three xxmaj judges was expressed but judgment could be singed by two xxmaj judges since one of the xxmaj judges died . xxmaj although , the facts of the above case was little different i.e. there was material to indicate that the third xxmaj judge who could not sign had also concurred with the opinion , but in the 16 present case there is no pleading of third member whether agreeing or not agreeing with the decision . xxmaj for the present case , we proceed on the premise that the third member did not agree with the decision . xxmaj for the decisions of this xxmaj court , xxmaj article 145 sub­clause ( 5 ) of the xxmaj constitution of xxmaj india provides that judge of this xxmaj court can deliver a judgment with the concurrence of a majority of the xxmaj judges present at the hearing of the case . \n",

       "  22 . xxmaj the present is a case where decision by a multi­member body is to be taken in the meeting of the xxmaj committee as per the statutory xxmaj rules . xxmaj there being no such majority provided for taking a decision , the decision by majority has to be accepted as the opinion of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority . \n",
       "  23 . xxmaj two more cases , which were relied by the appellant and noticed by the xxmaj high xxmaj court need to be noted . xxmaj the xxmaj privy xxmaj council judgment in xxmaj gokal xxmaj xxunk xxmaj jagan xxmaj nath xxmaj vs . xxmaj nand xxmaj ram xxmaj xxunk xxmaj atma xxmaj ram , xxup air ( 1938 ) xxup p.c. 292 , is relevant for the present case . xxmaj in the appeal before the xxmaj privy xxmaj council , judgment of the xxmaj high xxmaj court was assailed on the ground that the two xxmaj hon'ble xxmaj judges of the xxmaj high xxmaj court heard the matter , although , both judges concurred with the judgment , but one xxmaj judge went on leave 17 before signing the judgment , which was signed by only one xxmaj judge . xxmaj the xxmaj privy xxmaj council repelled the contention and held that signing by one of the xxmaj judges at best was only irregularity , not affecting the merits of the case . xxmaj following was laid down in xxmaj paragraphs 6 , 7 and 8:­ “ 6 . a further point was raised by the appellants . xxmaj they urged that the judgment of the xxmaj high xxmaj court appealed from was not a valid judgment because it failed to comply with xxmaj order xxup xli , xxmaj rule 31 , of the xxmaj code of xxmaj civil xxmaj procedure . xxmaj the relevant facts on this issue are that the hearing in the xxmaj high xxmaj court was before two xxmaj judges , xxmaj harrison and xxmaj agha xxmaj haider xxup jj . , and was actually delivered by the former xxmaj judge , the latter agreeing . xxmaj the judgment was delivered on xxmaj february 22 , 1933 . xxmaj but xxmaj harrison xxup j. went on leave before signing the judgment , which was signed by xxmaj agha xxmaj haider xxup j. , the xxmaj deputy xxmaj registrar appending a note that xxmaj harrison xxup j. had gone on leave before signing the judgment he delivered . \n",
       "  7 . xxmaj order xxup xli , xxmaj rule 31 requires that the judgment of the appellate xxmaj court shall be in writing and shall state various matters , and \" shall at the time that it is pronounced be signed and dated by the xxmaj judge or by the xxmaj judges concurring therein . \" \n",
       "  8 . xxmaj the xxmaj rule does not say that if its requirements are not complied with the judgment shall be a nullity . xxmaj so startling a result would need clear and precise words . xxmaj indeed the xxmaj rule does not even state any definite time in which it is to be fulfilled . xxmaj the time is left to be defined by what is reasonable . xxmaj the xxmaj rule from its very nature is not intended to affect the rights of parties to a judgment . xxmaj it is intended to secure certainty in the ascertainment of what the 18 judgment was . xxmaj it is a rule which xxmaj judges are required to comply with for that object . xxmaj no doubt in practice xxmaj judges do so comply , as it is their duty to do . xxmaj but accidents may happen . a xxmaj judge may die after giving judgment but before he has had a reasonable opportunity to sign it . xxmaj the xxmaj court must have inherent jurisdiction to supply such a defect . xxmaj the case of a xxmaj judge who has gone on leave before signing the judgment may call for more comment , but even so the convenience of the xxmaj court and the interest of litigants must prevail . xxmaj the defect is merely an irregularity . xxmaj but in truth the difficulty is disposed of by xxmaj sections 99 and 108 of the xxmaj civil xxmaj procedure xxmaj code . xxmaj section 99 provides that no decree shall be reversed or substantially varied nor shall any case be remanded , in appeal on account of any error , defect or irregularity in any proceedings in the suit , not affecting the merits of the case or the jurisdiction of the xxmaj court . xxmaj that xxmaj section xxunk in the part dealing with appeals from original decrees . xxmaj but xxmaj section 108 applies the same provision to appeals from appellate decrees and it is always in the discretion of the xxmaj board to apply the principle on appeal to xxmaj his xxmaj majesty in xxmaj council . xxmaj in their xxmaj lordships ' judgment , the defect here was an irregularity not affecting the merits of the case or the jurisdiction of the xxmaj court , and is no ground for setting aside the decree . ” \n",
       "  24 . xxmaj another judgment , which was cited by the appellant was xxup a. xxmaj shanta xxmaj rao xxmaj vs . xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj appellate xxmaj tribunal , xxmaj hyderabad & xxmaj ors . , xxup air 1985 xxup a.p. 256 . xxmaj in the above case , xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj appellate xxmaj tribunal consisting of xxmaj chairman and two members heard the matter . xxmaj however , the order was issued only with the signature of xxmaj chairman . xxmaj the order was attacked on the ground 19 that the other two members having not signed the order , the order is illegal . xxmaj repelling the contention following was stated in xxmaj paragraph xxunk “ 9 . xxmaj on the first question , i am of the view that once the minutes of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority are found to be signed by all the members including the xxmaj chairman , the mere fact that the final order is communicated under the signature of the xxmaj chairman alone does not amount to any illegality . xxmaj the xxmaj court has to see the substance of the matter and not the mere form , and if it is clear that all the members of the xxmaj tribunal have applied their mind to the facts of the case and arrived at a conclusion , it does not matter if the communication is made under the signature of the xxmaj chairman . ” \n",
       "  25 . xxmaj although , in above two cases , there was concurrence of all the members of xxmaj court / xxmaj tribunal but all had not signed the order . xxmaj the present is a case where xxmaj chairperson and two members heard the application in meeting dated 16.10.2014 but order was subsequently pronounced on 15.12.2014 and signed by only xxmaj chairperson and one member . xxmaj the third member having been transferred in the meanwhile . xxmaj as noticed above , there is no pleading in the writ petition as to whether the third member , who was transferred had agreed with the proposed order or did not agree with the decision , which was to be delivered by the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority . xxmaj had third member agreed , there can not be any debate in this matter , the issues being covered 20 by judgment of this xxmaj court in xxmaj ramaswamy xxmaj nadar(supra ) and judgment of the xxmaj privy xxmaj council in xxmaj gokal xxmaj chand xxunk xxmaj nath ( supra ) . xxmaj but there being neither any pleading nor any material to come to the conclusion that the third member has agreed with the opinion , we have proceeded to examine the present case as if , the third member did not agree with the order proposed . xxmaj we have already noticed the reason for coming to the conclusion that the order issued by the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority , signed by the xxmaj chairperson and one member is a valid order having been issued with the majority opinion of two out of three , who heard the application on 16.10.2014 . xxmaj thus , in any view of the matter , no illegality can be attached with the order dated 15.12.2014 , which was signed by the xxmaj chairperson and one member . \n",
       " \n",
       "  26 . xxmaj in view of the foregoing discussion , we are of the opinion that decision dated 15.12.2014 issued with the signatures of xxmaj chairperson and one member was a valid decision in spite of the fact that one of the members who was present in the hearing when the meeting took place on 16.10.2014 and had been transferred in the meanwhile did not sign the order . xxmaj the decision of the xxmaj state xxmaj transport xxmaj authority dated 15.12.2014 was fully in accordance with the statutory scheme of the xxmaj rules , 1994 and both the learned xxmaj single xxmaj judge and xxmaj division 21 xxmaj bench erred in holding the decision as invalid . xxmaj we , thus , are of the view that judgments of learned xxmaj single xxmaj judge and xxmaj division xxmaj bench do not express the correct view of the law . \n",

' xxmaj time xxmaj charters world over are considered a contract of service . xxmaj there is a difference between the ‘ right to use goods ’ and ‘ the transfer of the right to use goods . ’ xxmaj in case of a lease , there is a transfer of an interest in the property , whereas , in a licence , there is a mere right to use the property . xxmaj the xxmaj time xxmaj charter is recognised as an agreement in the nature of pure service . xxmaj they are entirely distinct from xxmaj bareboat xxmaj charter xxmaj agreement or charter by demise . xxmaj the charters are of three kinds viz . ( a ) xxmaj time 4 xxmaj charter , ( b ) xxmaj bareboat xxmaj charter or xxmaj charter by xxmaj demise , and ( c ) xxmaj voyage xxmaj charter . xxmaj time charter and voyage charter are contracts of service , whereas bareboat charter amounts to transfer of right to use the ship itself . xxmaj in a time charter , master and crew are in the employment of the owner , and complete control , ownership , and possession of the vessel remain only with the owner through the master and crew . xxmaj the delivery to the xxmaj port xxmaj trust is only a symbolic one , and the legal and physical possession of xxmaj tug continues to be with the company . xxmaj thus , the arrangement is a service , not a lease . xxmaj learned senior counsel has made reference to xxmaj scrutton on charter parties , xxmaj halsbury 's xxmaj laws of xxmaj england , and have also relied upon various decisions . \n",
       "  6 . xxmaj mr. xxmaj datar has further submitted that the xxmaj port xxmaj trust can not use the xxmaj tug for any purpose except , as mentioned in clause 3 of the xxmaj agreement . xxmaj the xxmaj port xxmaj trust can not take away the xxmaj tug outside the harbour limits of the xxmaj port xxmaj trust . xxmaj legal possession and fiscal control had not been transferred to the xxmaj port xxmaj trust , and only a conditional use of the vessel has been given . xxmaj the use of the words ‘ at the disposal of xxmaj port ' in clause 7 is a standard term used in all charter agreements , and these do not indicate the transfer of legal possession or transfer of fiscal control . xxmaj the contract indicates various liabilities and responsibilities of the owner ; the insurance has to be provided by the appellants . xxmaj for the performance of service , the xxmaj bank xxmaj guarantee also 5 has to be given . xxmaj the owner is responsible for damage to his xxmaj tug , xxmaj jetty , port premises , or any other vessel in the port . xxmaj the company is responsible for providing indemnity to the charterer . xxmaj thus , the owner has not lost his control over the vessel . \n",

       "  10 . xxmaj it was submitted that the xxmaj high xxmaj court has erred in treating the territorial water as part of the territory of xxmaj karnataka , in contravention to xxmaj article 297 as well as the provisions of the xxmaj territorial xxmaj waters , xxmaj continental xxmaj shelf , xxmaj exclusive xxmaj economic xxmaj zone , and other xxmaj maritime xxmaj zones xxmaj act , 1976 ( xxmaj act of 1976 ) . xxmaj none of the maritime xxmaj states have been given the territorial waters as part of their territory . xxmaj he has also referred to xxmaj dr. xxmaj ambedkar ’s speech in the xxmaj constituent xxmaj assembly to submit that the entire territorial waters would exclusively belong to 7 the xxmaj union , and it is only by way of an exception through xxmaj entry 21 in xxmaj list xxup ii that “ fisheries ” has been kept under the control of a xxmaj state xxmaj government . xxmaj the xxmaj state xxmaj government is , thus , competent to regulate fishing up to the territorial waters . xxmaj the same would again be restricted by xxmaj entry 57 of xxmaj list i , which provides that fisheries beyond the territorial waters would be under the control of the xxmaj union as per xxmaj entry 21 , xxmaj list xxup ii . xxmaj the xxmaj karnataka xxmaj marine and xxmaj fishing ( xxmaj regulation ) xxmaj act , 1986 ( xxmaj act of 1986 ) was passed by the xxmaj state legislature , within purview of powers as per xxmaj entry 21 of xxmaj list xxup ii . xxmaj section 2(j ) of the xxmaj act of 1986 has defined xxmaj karnataka xxmaj state to include the territorial waters , but that has to be read in the context of xxmaj entry 21 in xxmaj list xxup ii . xxmaj the definition in section 2(j ) is confined to the regulation of fisheries , and can not be interpreted to mean that the territorial waters belong to xxmaj karnataka . xxmaj the xxmaj state can not claim 12 nautical miles as part of its territory ; otherwise , each maritime xxmaj state can pass laws with any of the items mentioned in xxmaj list xxup ­i regarding the activities in the territorial waters , which are the prerogative of the xxmaj parliament . \n",

       "  11 . xxmaj mr. xxmaj datar has further submitted that under xxmaj entries 56 and 57 of xxmaj list xxup ii , the xxmaj state legislature has the competence to levy tax on the carriage of goods and passengers only on inland waters base . xxmaj by implication , any taxes on the carriage of goods or passengers in the territorial waters is outside the legislative competence of the xxmaj state 8 legislature . xxmaj entries 25 to 27 of xxmaj list i indicate that the entire shipping industry is exclusively within the domain of xxmaj parliament . xxmaj entry 27 of list­i cover the ports , and the agreement is with the xxmaj port xxmaj trust . xxmaj he has further attracted our attention to section 5 of the xxmaj territorial xxmaj waters xxmaj act , 1976 . xxmaj section 5 defines the contiguous zone to be at a distance of 24 nautical miles from the nearest point of the xxunk . xxmaj the xxmaj central xxmaj government has the exclusive power to make laws concerning customs and other fiscal matters on activities that take place in the contiguous zone . xxmaj the xxmaj territorial xxmaj waters xxmaj act prevails over the xxmaj state legislature dealing with sales tax , i.e. , the xxup kst xxmaj act . xxmaj thus , the decision in 20th xxmaj century xxmaj finance xxmaj corporation xxmaj ltd. v. xxmaj state of xxmaj maharashtra , 2000 ( 6 ) xxup scc 12 is not attracted in which this xxmaj court was concerned with the controversy as to which xxmaj state could levy sales tax , where signing of the contract , delivery of the goods or use of the rights were in different xxmaj states . xxmaj the majority held that the xxmaj state where a contract is signed would have the power to levy a sales tax . xxmaj thus , the place where the goods were delivered or used could not be a ground for levy of sales tax . xxmaj merely signing of the contract in xxmaj mangalore conferred no jurisdiction to levy sales­tax on the xxmaj state of xxmaj karnataka . xxmaj the decision has no application to the transaction , the effect of which takes place in territorial waters or the high seas , even if the agreement is signed within a particular xxmaj state . 9 \n",
       "  12 . xxmaj mr. xxmaj mohan xxmaj parasaran , learned senior counsel has taken us in detail to various clauses of the agreement . xxmaj the agreement is in the nature of a time charter as approved by the xxmaj new xxmaj york xxmaj produce xxmaj exchange ( xxup xxunk ) , which is the standard form for time charters . xxmaj it is neither a bareboat cum demise charter nor a voyage charter and is , therefore , only a time charter because of terms and conditions . xxmaj he has relied upon xxup bsnl v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india , ( 2006 ) 3 xxup scc 1 wherein this xxmaj court has laid down essential attributes of a transaction to constitute a transfer of the right to use the goods . xxmaj at no point of time , the vessel should go out of the possession or control of the company , therefore the essential ingredient to constitute it a transfer of the right to use is missing . xxmaj he has also referred to xxup dlf xxmaj universal xxmaj ltd. v. xxmaj director , xxmaj town and xxmaj country xxmaj planning xxmaj department , xxmaj haryana , ( 2010 ) 14 xxup scc 1 . xxmaj the very language of the agreement makes it clear to be a contract of service . xxmaj the expressions like delivery and re­delivery are not to be understood in a literal sense . xxmaj there are certain obligations upon the company , which makes out that effective control over the vessel is with the company . xxmaj he had also referred to xxmaj harbour xxmaj craft xxmaj rules . xxmaj the tug is always operated , controlled , run , maintained , and insured by the company . xxmaj possession of the xxmaj tug remains with it . xxmaj in the event the tug is disabled from use , the charterer is not required to pay xxunk 10 party charges to the company . xxmaj the company has to indemnify the charterer . \n",

       "  25 . xxmaj in the case at hand , the first respondent was treated as disqualified on the foundation that he was in service of the xxmaj government . xxmaj in this context , we may usefully refer to the letter of appointment issued by the xxmaj government of xxmaj bihar , xxmaj legal ( xxmaj justice ) xxmaj department to the xxmaj district xxmaj magistrate , xxmaj nalanda . xxmaj it reads as follows:­ \" xxmaj letter xxunk / xxup xxunk ) xxunk / 98 / xxunk / b xxmaj government of xxmaj bihar xxmaj legal ( xxmaj justice ) xxmaj department 34 xxmaj from xxmaj sri xxmaj birendra xxmaj singh , xxmaj joint xxmaj secretary to the xxmaj government , xxmaj bihar xxmaj to xxmaj district xxmaj magistrate , xxmaj nalanda , xxmaj xxunk xxmaj patna , xxmaj dated 18th xxmaj august , 2000 xxmaj sub . : xxmaj in relation to appointment of xxmaj assistant xxmaj government xxmaj advocate for the xxmaj court at xxmaj nalanda and xxmaj xxunk xxmaj sir , xxmaj in reference to your letter xxmaj no . xxunk dated xxunk on above mentioned subject and law xxmaj department xxmaj letter xxmaj no . xxunk dated xxunk as per direction i have to inform that the xxmaj state xxmaj government has been kind to appoint xxmaj sri xxmaj xxunk xxmaj prasad , xxmaj advocate on the post of xxmaj assistant xxmaj government xxmaj advocate in the panel of xxmaj assistant xxmaj government xxmaj advocates constituted for the xxmaj court at xxmaj nalanda and xxmaj xxunk . \n",

       "  27 . xxmaj in the obtaining factual score , would it be appropriate to accept the submission of the appellants that the elected candidate was in the service of the government . xxmaj the legislature has , in exercise of its legislative power and wisdom , not used the words “ office of profit ” . xxmaj therefore , whether such a letter of appointment can be construed to determine if the person is holding an office of profit is not necessary to be addressed although we have referred to certain authorities to appreciate the context and its fundamental purpose . xxmaj in the instant case , the election pertains to a xxmaj panchayat xxmaj samiti which basically 36 relates to the concept at the grass root level . xxmaj the legislature , as it seems to us , has not thought of office of profit because had it thought so it would have provided in that manner . xxmaj in xxmaj xxunk xxmaj ali ( supra ) , the legislature had provided a disqualification keeping in view the conflict of interest . xxmaj the absence of such a provision possibly is to include persons from different fields as long as they are not in service under the government or a service in an institution receiving aids from the xxmaj central or xxmaj state xxmaj government or any local authority . xxmaj the legislature , as the postulate stands today , has confined to categories of service mentioned hereinbefore . xxmaj it depends on the legislative wisdom . xxmaj it further needs to be stated that the nature of disqualification has to be strictly construed keeping in mind that right to contest an election is not a fundamental right but the said right may be curtailed under valid statutory provision . \n",
       "  28 . xxmaj the aforesaid being the position , we may presently focus on what constitutes a service . xxmaj in xxmaj state of xxmaj assam and others 37 v. xxmaj kanak xxmaj chandra xxmaj xxunk , xxmaj bachawat , xxup j. , speaking for the xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench , held that a person holding a post under a xxmaj state is a person serving or employed under the xxmaj state . xxmaj there is a relationship of master and servant between the xxmaj state and a person holding a post under it . xxmaj the existence of this relationship is indicated by the xxmaj state 's right to select and appoint the holder of the post , its right to suspend and dismiss him , its right to control the manner and method of his doing the work and the payment by it of his wages or remuneration . a relationship of master and servant may be established by the presence of all or some of these indicia , in conjunction with other circumstances and it is a question of fact in each case whether there is such a relation between the xxmaj state and the alleged holder of a post . \n",
       "  29 . xxmaj in this regard , reference to another xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench decision in xxmaj roshan xxmaj lal xxmaj tandon v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india14 would be apposite . xxmaj in the said case , it has been opined that the legal position of a xxmaj government servant is more one of status than a 13 xxup air 1967 xxup sc 884 14 xxup air 1967 xxup sc 1889 38 contract . xxmaj the xxunk of status is the attachment to legal relationship of rights and duties imposed by the public law and not by mere agreement by the parties . xxmaj the duties of status are fixed by the law and status is a condition of membership of a group of which powers and duties are exclusively determined by law and not by agreement between the parties concerned . xxmaj as is evincible , emphasis was given on the status in contradistinction to contractual service . \n",
       "  30 . xxmaj learned counsel appearing for the xxmaj commission , has placed heavy reliance on xxmaj kumari xxmaj shrilekha xxmaj vidyarthi and others v. xxmaj state of xxup u.p. and others15 . xxmaj in the said case , the xxmaj government of the xxmaj state of xxup u.p. had terminated by a general order the appointments of all xxmaj government xxmaj counsel ( xxmaj civil , xxmaj criminal , xxmaj revenue ) in all the districts of the xxmaj state of xxup u.p. xxmaj the xxmaj high xxmaj court had upheld the circular by which the order was passed . xxmaj in appeal , by special leave , the xxmaj court dealt with two contentions , namely , the nature of appointments and the minimum basis of status attached to those appointments . xxmaj for 15 ( 1991 ) 1 xxup scc 212 39 the purpose of examination whether the ground of arbitrariness was available to vitiate the circular , the xxmaj court referred to the xxmaj legal xxmaj remembrancer 's xxmaj manual and especially paragraphs 7.06 to xxunk which deals with appointment and renewal of local practitioners finally selected by the government . xxmaj the said paragraph deals with the term , tenure , bar on political activity , renewal of term and character roll . \n",
       "  31 . xxmaj relying on the same and other aspects , the xxmaj court held:­ \" xxmaj the above provisions in the xxup l.r. xxmaj manual clearly show that the xxmaj government xxmaj counsel in the districts are treated as xxmaj law xxmaj officers of the xxmaj state who are holders of an ' office ' or ‘ post ' . xxmaj the aforesaid provisions in xxmaj chapter xxup vii relating to appointment and conditions of engagement of xxmaj district xxmaj government xxmaj counsel show that the appointments are to be made and ordinarily renewed on objective assessment of suitability of the person based on the opinion of the xxmaj district xxmaj officer and the xxmaj district xxmaj judge ; and character roll is maintained for keeping a record of the suitability of the appointee to enable an objective assessment for the purpose of his continuance as a xxmaj law xxmaj officer in the district . xxmaj there are provisions to bar private practice and participation in political activity by xxunk . xxmaj apart from clause 3 of para 7.06 to which we shall advert a little later , these provisions clearly indicate that the 40 appointment and engagement of xxmaj district xxmaj government xxmaj counsel is not the same as that by a private litigant of his counsel and there is obviously an element of continuity of the appointment unless the appointee is found to be unsuitable either by his own work , conduct or age or in comparison to any more suitable candidate available at the place of appointment . xxmaj suitability of the appointee being the prime criterion for any such appointment , it is obvious that appointment of the best amongst those available , is the object sought to be achieved by these provisions , which , even otherwise , should be the paramount consideration in discharge of this governmental function aimed at promoting public interest . xxmaj all xxmaj govt . xxmaj counsel are paid remuneration out of the public exchequer and there is a clear public element attaching to the ' office ' or ' post ' . \" xxmaj after so stating , the xxmaj court referred to xxmaj sections 24 and 321 of the xxmaj code of xxmaj criminal xxmaj procedure and further analyzed the ratio in xxmaj xxunk xxmaj prasad xxmaj singh v. xxmaj state of xxmaj xxunk and xxmaj mukul xxmaj dalal and others v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india and others17 and came to hold that the office of the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor is a public one and the primacy given to the xxmaj public xxmaj prosecutor under the scheme of xxmaj code has a social purpose . 16 ( 1979 ) 4 xxup scc 701 17 ( 1988 ) 3 xxup scc 144 41 \n",
       "  32 . xxmaj in this regard , we may reproduce a passage from the said authority which is as follows:­ “ xxmaj we are , therefore , unable to accept the argument of the learned xxmaj additional xxmaj advocate xxmaj general that the appointment of xxmaj district xxmaj government xxmaj counsel by the xxmaj state xxmaj government is only a professional engagement like that between a private client and his lawyer , or that it is purely contractual with no public element attaching to it , which may be terminated at any time at the sweet will of the xxmaj government excluding judicial review . xxmaj we have already indicated the presence of public element attached to the ` office ' or ` post ' of xxmaj district xxmaj government xxmaj counsel of every category covered by the impugned circular . xxmaj this is sufficient to attract xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution and bring the question of validity of the impugned circular within the scope of judicial review . ” \n",
       "  33 . xxmaj eventually , the xxmaj court analyzing the test of xxmaj article 14 , opined:­ “ xxmaj in our opinion , the wide sweep of xxmaj article 14 undoubtedly takes within its fold the impugned circular issued by the xxmaj state of xxup u.p. in exercise of its executive power , irrespective of the precise nature of appointment of the xxmaj government xxmaj counsel in the districts and the other rights , contractual or statutory , which the appointees may have . xxmaj it is for this reason that we base our decision on the ground 42 that independent of any statutory right , available to the appointees , and assuming for the purpose of this case that the rights flow only from the contract of appointment , the impugned circular , issued in exercise of the executive power of the xxmaj state , must satisfy xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution and if it is shown to be arbitrary , it must be struck down . xxmaj however , we have referred to certain provisions relating to initial appointment , termination or renewal of tenure to indicate that the action is controlled at least by settled guidelines , followed by the xxmaj state of xxup u.p. , for a long time . xxmaj this too is relevant for deciding the question of arbitrariness alleged in the present case . ” xxmaj the aforesaid passages clearly show that the xxmaj court went by the concept of public element attached to the office or post of xxmaj government xxmaj pleader . xxmaj it has not expressed the opinion that they are under the xxmaj government service . xxmaj be that as it may , as has been held by the learned xxmaj single xxmaj judge and rightly so , there is no xxunk relationship and the respondent was not amenable to any disciplinary proceeding . xxmaj he has correctly expressed the view that the conduct of the advocate is subject to the discipline of the xxmaj bar xxmaj council . xxmaj as we notice , there is nothing on record to show that he was getting any remuneration . xxmaj even if some remuneration is attached to the 43 office , he can not be treated to be under the service of the xxmaj state xxmaj government . xxmaj the aspects which are essential for establishing a relationship of master and servant are absent . xxmaj therefore , the returned candidate could not have been treated to be in service under the xxmaj state xxmaj government . \n",

       "  ( a ) xxmaj relatable to the second renewal of the mining leases : ( i ) xxmaj in view of the decision in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation only fresh leases were to be granted by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa and not second renewals .

       "  36 . xxmaj the controversy in this regard has arisen in view of what is stated in paragraph 82 of the decision in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation . xxmaj it was stated as follows : xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 27 of 101 “ xxmaj as we have held that the deemed mining leases of the lessees in xxmaj goa expired on 22 - 11 - 1987 and the maximum period ( 20 years ) of renewal of the deemed mining leases in xxmaj goa has also expired on 22- 11 - 2007 , mining by the lessees in xxmaj goa after 22 - 11 - 2007 was illegal . xxmaj hence , the xxmaj order dated 10 - 9 - 2012 of the xxmaj government of xxmaj goa suspending mining operations in the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa and the xxmaj order dated 14 - 9 - 2012 of moef , xxmaj government of xxmaj india , suspending the environmental clearances granted to the mines in the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa , which have been impugned in the writ petitions in the xxmaj bombay xxmaj high xxmaj court , xxmaj goa xxmaj bench ( transferred to this xxmaj court and registered as transferred cases ) can not be quashed by this xxmaj court . xxmaj the xxmaj order dated xxunk of the xxmaj government of xxmaj goa and the xxmaj order dated 14.9.2012 of the moef will have to continue till decisions are taken by the xxmaj state xxmaj government to grant fresh leases and decisions are taken by moef to grant fresh environmental clearances for mining projects . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] . \n",
       "  37 . xxmaj the issue that arose for discussion before us was the meaning and intention of the xxmaj court in the context of grant of „ fresh xxunk for mining projects . xxmaj did the xxmaj court literally mean that a fresh mining lease was required to be granted or was a second renewal sufficient compliance ? \n",
       "  38 . xxmaj as the above quoted paragraph indicates , the xxmaj court was aware and conscious of the fact that the mining leases had expired on 22nd xxmaj november , 2007 and the mining operations thereafter carried out by the mining lease holders was illegal . xxmaj for this reason , the xxmaj court held that the suspension order passed by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa on 10th xxmaj september , 2012 and the abeyance order passed by the moef on 14th xxmaj september , 2012 did not require any interference . \n",

       "  39 . xxmaj since the mining operations carried out after 22nd xxmaj november , 2007 were illegal , the xxmaj court , in subsequent paragraphs of the judgment noted ( as a follow up ) that an order was passed on 5th xxmaj october , 2012 suspending transportation of iron ore and manganese ore from those leases identified by the xxmaj justice xxmaj shah xxmaj xxunk xxmaj thereafter on 11th xxmaj november , 2013 it was directed that an inventory be made of the excavated mineral ores and the xxunk mineral ores be sold by e - auction under the supervision of a xxmaj monitoring xxmaj xxunk \n",

       " \n",
       "  xxmaj it was then directed by the xxmaj court in paragraph xxunk of the xxmaj report as follows : \n",
       "  41 . xxmaj the xxmaj court was quite obviously aware that it was concerned , inter alia , with the second renewal of mining leases and yet it chose to recount the factual situation , make a declaration and pass a direction without adverting to the possibility of a second renewal of a mining lease . xxmaj the xxmaj court was also conscious that the mining lease holders had carried out indiscriminate and illegal mining for about five years ( from xxmaj november 2007 to xxmaj september 2012 ) and had made profits out of the illegal mining . xxmaj the xxmaj court , in our opinion , was rather charitable in not penalizing the mining lease holders for the illegal mining carried out by them . xxmaj but be that as it may , quite clearly , the sequence of events from xxmaj september 2012 onwards , the appointment of a xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 30 of 101 xxmaj monitoring xxmaj committee to dispose of the illegally mined ore , the declaration and direction unmistakably point to the intention of the xxmaj court to end the sordid chapter of illegal mining by the lease holders and start on a clean slate . xxmaj viewed in this perspective , we have no doubt that the xxmaj court really did intend the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to consider the grant of fresh leases in accordance with law . \n",
       "  42 . xxmaj in this context , the declaration of the xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation in paragraph 87.5 of xxmaj report is also quite clear , namely , “ xxmaj it is for the xxmaj state xxmaj government to decide as a matter of policy in what manner mining leases are to be granted in future … . ” xxmaj the declaration was explicit and related to the grant of mining leases and not a second renewal . \n",
       "  43 . xxmaj similarly , the direction given in paragraph xxunk of the xxmaj report that “ xxmaj the xxmaj state xxmaj government may grant mining leases of iron ore and other ores in xxmaj goa in accordance with its policy decision … .. ” was equally explicit and related to the grant of mining leases and not a second renewal . \n",
       "  44 . xxmaj subsequent events confirm our impression and view . xxmaj the decision of the xxmaj court to e - auction the mined mineral ore was sought to be recalled through xxup i.a. xxmaj no . 86 of 2014 filed by m / s xxmaj xxunk xxmaj brothers xxmaj private xxmaj ltd. xxmaj the applicant prayed for a direction to restrain the authorities from e- auctioning the iron ore mined by it prior to 22nd xxmaj november , 2007 and that xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 31 of 101 the mined ore should be released to the applicant with the right to dispose of the same . a xxmaj bench of three learned judges ( other than those that decided xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation ) noted that : “ xxmaj the submissions advanced on behalf of the applicant were premised merely on the assertion , that the mineral ore which the applicant was claiming a right over , had been legitimately mined before xxunk , and therefore , the applicant had an absolute and legitimate ownership over the same . xxmaj we may note , that the above position was emphasized , stressed and persistently reiterated to make the stand absolutely crystal clear . ” xxmaj the learned judges considered the submissions and held by an order dated 14th xxmaj october , 2014 that the direction in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation was clear and categorical that the iron ore vested in the xxmaj state xxmaj government and therefore the application deserved dismissal . xxmaj in other words , the mining lease holders deserved no latitude for the illegal mining and all issues needed to be dealt with strictly . \n",
       "  45 . xxmaj there is additional material to support the view that the xxmaj court had intended the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant fresh mining leases rather than grant a second renewal . \n",
       "  46 . xxmaj from a reading of the decision rendered by the xxmaj bombay xxmaj high xxmaj court in xxmaj lithoferro ( subject matter of xxup slp ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 and xxup slp ( c ) xxmaj nos . 32699 - 32727 of 2015 ) it is evident that the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa understood the xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 32 of 101 decision of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation to mean that fresh mining leases were required to be granted on the basis of a policy yet to be framed by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa and the issue of second renewals did not survive consideration . xxmaj the contention of the learned xxmaj advocate xxmaj general of the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa in this regard is recorded by the xxmaj high xxmaj court in the following words : \n",
       "  47 . xxmaj while considering the submissions of the learned xxmaj advocate xxmaj general and learned counsel , the xxmaj high xxmaj court noted that this xxmaj court was alive to the xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 33 of 101 fact that the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa had granted in - principle second renewal to 28 mining leases and had collected renewal fees or stamp duty from 27 mining leases ( presumably out of the 28 mining leases ) as stated in the brief resume filed by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa in this xxmaj court . xxmaj the xxmaj high xxmaj court noted : \n",
       "  48 . xxmaj in other words , notwithstanding the in - principle grant of second renewal of 28 mining leases and collection of renewal fees or stamp duty , this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation consciously required the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant fresh leases . xxmaj what is equally significant is that the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa also understood the decision of the xxmaj court in the same manner and intended to act on that basis . \n",
       "  49 . xxmaj unfortunately , the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa was overtaken by events in that the xxmaj high xxmaj court delivered its judgment in xxmaj lithoferro on 13th xxmaj august , 2014 and while doing so , it misunderstood or incorrectly appreciated the decision of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation and disagreed with the view of the xxmaj state of xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 34 of 101 xxmaj goa . xxmaj while this xxmaj court had required the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant fresh mining leases and the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa was willing to comply with this direction , the xxmaj high xxmaj court instead directed it to execute mining leases under xxmaj section 8(3 ) of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act in respect of those who had paid the renewal fees or stamp duty . xxmaj the xxmaj high xxmaj court also directed the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to decide their pending second renewal applications within a period of three months keeping in mind the provisions of xxmaj section 8(3 ) of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act ( presumably after paying the renewal fees or stamp duty in terms of the xxmaj government order of 21 st xxmaj february , 2013 ) . xxmaj the understanding by the xxmaj high xxmaj court of the decision of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation is totally incorrect . \n",
       "  50 . xxmaj it appears from the contents of the xxmaj grant of xxmaj mining xxmaj leases xxmaj policy that in view of the decision of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation the xxmaj state was actively considering a policy for granting fresh mining leases by considering several factors . xxmaj however , the decision and directions of the xxmaj high xxmaj court xxunk leaving no choice , according to the xxmaj state , but to completely abandon the process of grant of fresh mining leases through the process of competitive bidding for earning revenue and justify the abandonment . \n",
       "  51 . xxmaj as per the xxmaj grant of xxmaj mining xxmaj leases xxmaj policy , the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa therefore had two realistic options before it : ( i ) xxmaj to implement the judgment and order of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation ( as understood by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa ) and xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 35 of 101 grant fresh mining leases in the manner felt appropriate and in accordance with law ; ( ii ) xxmaj to abide by the judgment of the xxmaj high xxmaj court ( and its understanding of the judgment of this xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation while rejecting its understanding by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa ) and grant second renewal to the mining leases in terms of xxmaj section 8(3 ) of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act . xxmaj the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa appears to have taken the view that challenging the decision of the xxmaj high xxmaj court ( and therefore abiding by the decision of this xxmaj court ) would delay the commencement of mining operations . xxmaj the xxmaj state took into consideration that a substantial portion of its revenue comes from the mining sector and that the xxmaj state had been virtually starved of funds on account of stoppage of mining operations . xxmaj therefore , the xxmaj state decided to grant a second renewal to the mining leases and not grant fresh leases . xxmaj this is quite apparent from the contents of the xxmaj grant of xxmaj mining xxmaj leases xxmaj policy wherein the above facts and conclusions have been stated in greater detail . xxmaj was this decision correct ? \n",
       "  52 . xxmaj learned counsel for the mining lease holders submitted that the renewal of a mining lease is equivalent to or amounts to the grant of a fresh lease and therefore when the mining leases were renewed , it amounted to the grant of a fresh lease in compliance with the directions of this xxmaj court . xxmaj reliance was placed upon xxmaj delhi xxmaj development xxmaj authority v. xxmaj durga xxmaj chand xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 36 of 101 xxmaj xxunk wherein this xxmaj court held : \n",
       "  ( 1973 ) 2 xxup scc 825 12 1989 xxmaj supp ( 1 ) xxup scc 487 13 ( 2004 ) 12 xxup scc 118 14 ( 2015 ) 8 xxup scc 655 15 ( 1997 ) 1 xxup scc 650 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 37 of 101 \n",
       "  55 . xxmaj there is no doubt that the renewal of a lease is virtually the same as the grant of a fresh lease but a converse direction to grant a mining lease can not be understood to mean granting a renewal of a mining lease . xxmaj obviously , the grant of a fresh lease is not the same as the renewal of a lease and when the xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation required the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant a fresh lease , it did not require the xxmaj state to renew the existing ( expired ) lease . xxmaj the xxmaj court could have explicitly declared and directed the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant a second renewal of the mining leases rather than to say it in a xxunk manner that it should do so by granting a fresh lease equivalent to a renewal . xxmaj we simply can not accept the submissions made by learned counsel for the mining lease holders in this regard . \n",
       "  56 . xxmaj that apart , as we have already noted above , the context and material on record xxunk the thought that the xxmaj court in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation did not mandate the grant of fresh mining leases in accordance with law . \n",
       "  57 . xxmaj learned counsel for the mining lease holders contended that the very same learned judges that decided xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation permitted the xxmaj state xxmaj government in xxmaj common xxmaj cause v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india16 to consider granting a second renewal of mining leases under xxmaj section 8(3 ) of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act . xxmaj therefore the requirement in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation for the grant of „ fresh xxunk 16 ( 2014 ) 14 xxup scc 155 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 38 of 101 must be understood in a manner similar to what was directed in xxmaj common xxmaj cause . xxmaj we are unable to accept this contention . xxmaj the direction given in xxmaj common xxmaj cause was an interim direction and not a final direction as in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation . xxmaj moreover , the facts in both cases are not at all similar so as to warrant a similar order being passed or understood . xxmaj finally , the fact that the same set of learned judges thought it fit to direct the grant of „ fresh xxunk in one set of cases and thought it fit to direct consideration of a „ second xxunk in another set of cases indicates that the learned judges were aware of the difference in directions . xxmaj therefore when the leaned judges directed the grant of „ fresh xxunk in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation it was a deliberate and conscious decision distinct and different from granting a second renewal of expired mining leases . \n",
       "  58 . xxmaj in our opinion , the direction in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation is quite clear and instead of considering the grant of a second renewal of the mining leases , the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa was required to consider the grant of fresh mining leases . xxmaj therefore the decision of the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant a second renewal of the mining leases is erroneous , contrary to the decision in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation and must be and is quashed . \n",
       "  xxmaj whether the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa should have auctioned the mining leases ? \n",
       "  59 . xxmaj as mentioned in the xxmaj grant of xxmaj mining xxmaj leases xxmaj policy there were several xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 39 of 101 options available to the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa . xxmaj it took the view that all its options were foreclosed post the decision of the xxmaj high xxmaj court and it was obliged to grant a second renewal of the mining leases . xxmaj we have already held that this was not so and that the decision to grant a second renewal of the mining leases was erroneous and fresh leases were required to be granted in accordance with the decision in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation . xxmaj in view of our conclusion , the discussion on whether the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa should have auctioned the mining leases through a process of competitive bidding is now rendered academic . xxmaj however , since detailed submissions were made by learned counsel on both sides , including by the learned xxmaj additional xxmaj solicitor xxmaj general , we propose to express our views on the subject . \n",
       "  60 . xxmaj the discussion on the question of auction being the only method of allocation or disposal of natural resources arose due to the view expressed by this xxmaj court in xxmaj centre for xxmaj public xxmaj interest xxmaj litigation v. xxmaj union of xxmaj xxunk xxmaj in that decision ( hereafter referred to as xxup cpil – although this case is generally referred to as the 2 g scam case ) the xxmaj court dealt with the question of following a non - discriminatory policy for alienation of natural resources . xxmaj while doing so it was observed that an auction is “ perhaps the best method for discharging this burden ” and concluded by holding that “ while 17 ( 2012 ) 3 xxup scc 1 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 40 of 101 transferring or alienating the natural resources , the xxmaj state is duty - bound to adopt the method of auction by giving wide publicity so that all eligible persons can participate in the process . ” xxmaj this led to the belief that the view of this xxmaj court was that natural resources should be alienated or disposed of only by auction and by no other method . xxmaj the xxmaj court held in paragraphs 95 and 96 of the xxmaj report as follows : \n",
       "  61 . xxmaj in xxmaj manohar xxmaj lal xxmaj sharma v. xxmaj principal xxmaj xxunk a xxmaj bench of 3 judges of this xxmaj court paraphrased the above passages and observed that the view 18 ( 2014 ) 9 xxup scc 516 xxup s.l.p.

       "  62 . xxmaj what was the xxmaj advisory xxmaj opinion given by this xxmaj court in xxmaj natural xxmaj resources xxmaj allocation ? xxmaj among the questions referred for opinion were the following : \n",
       "  63 . xxmaj in the xxmaj reference , it was submitted before the xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench that paragraphs 94 to 96 in xxup cpil laid down the ratio vis - à - vis disposal of natural resources . xxmaj it was argued that “ these paragraphs lay down , as a proposition of law , that all natural resources across all sectors , and in all circumstances are to be disposed of by way of public auction , and on the other [ hand ] , it was urged that the observations therein were made only qua spectrum . ” \n",
       "  64 . xxmaj the submissions made by learned counsel were then discussed and thereafter this xxmaj court recorded its conclusions between paragraphs 82 and 84 of xxmaj natural xxmaj resources xxmaj allocation . xxmaj in paragraph 84 , it was held : 19 ( 2012 ) 10 xxup scc 1 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 42 of 101 “ 84 . xxmaj thus , having come to the conclusion that 2 g case20 does not deal with modes of allocation for natural resources , other than spectrum , we shall now proceed to answer the first question of the xxmaj reference pertaining to other natural resources , as the question subsumes the essence of the entire reference , particularly the set of first five questions . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] . \n",

       "  65 . xxmaj thereafter , while answering the first question in the xxmaj reference , the xxmaj court considered the issue from various perspectives . xxmaj it first dealt with the issue in the context of xxmaj article 14 and xxmaj article 39(b ) of the xxmaj constitution and concluded in paragraph 120 of the xxmaj report that the disposal of natural resources for revenue maximization through auctions is not a constitutional mandate . xxmaj it was held : \n",
       "  66 . xxmaj the issue was then considered from the standpoint of legitimate deviations from an auction . xxmaj after adverting to several decisions of this xxmaj court 20 xxmaj centre for xxmaj public xxmaj interest xxmaj litigation v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india ( xxup cpil case or 2 g scam case ) xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 43 of 101 where auctions were not the favoured method of allocation of natural resources , it was held between paragraphs 129 and 131 of the xxmaj report as follows : \n",
       "  ( 1980 ) 4 xxup scc 1 xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 44 of 101 \n",
       "  67 . xxmaj finally , the issue was considered from the point of view of the potential of abuse in allocation of natural resources other than through auction and in this context it was held in paragraph 135 of the xxmaj report : \n",
       "  68 . xxmaj the conclusion arrived at by the xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench was then recorded between paragraphs 148 and 150 of the xxmaj report in the following words : \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj regard being had to the aforesaid precepts , we have opined that auction as a mode can not be conferred the status of a constitutional xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 45 of 101 principle . xxmaj alienation of natural resources is a policy decision , and the means adopted for the same are thus , executive prerogatives . xxmaj however , when such a policy decision is not backed by a social or welfare purpose , and precious and scarce natural resources are alienated for commercial pursuits of profit maximising private entrepreneurs , adoption of means other than those that are competitive and maximise revenue may be arbitrary and face the wrath of xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution . xxmaj hence , rather than prescribing or proscribing a method , we believe , a judicial scrutiny of methods of disposal of natural resources should depend on the facts and circumstances of each case , in consonance with the principles which we have culled out above . xxmaj failing which , the xxmaj court , in exercise of power of judicial review , shall term the executive action as arbitrary , unfair , unreasonable and capricious due to its antimony with xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution . \n",
       "  xxmaj in conclusion , our answer to the first set of five questions is that auctions are not the only permissible method for disposal of all natural resources across all sectors and in all circumstances . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] . \n",
       " \n",
       "  69 . xxmaj it is therefore more than explicit that there is no constitutional requirement ( let alone a mandate ) for allocation of natural resources through the auction method ( other than spectrum ) but at the same time the auction process should not be given a go - bye without any justification – the decision to give a go - bye is judicially reviewable though the scope of judicial review might be rather restricted . xxmaj the melting pot of allocation of a natural resource , a social or welfare purpose and adherence to the requirements of xxmaj articles 14 and 39(b ) of the xxmaj constitution in matters of policy was a great leap forward fashioned by the xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench . xxmaj consequently , while xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 46 of 101 there is no mandate , constitutional or otherwise , that natural resource allocation must be only by auction , it is certainly “ a more preferable method ” . xxmaj there are exceptions , such as when the natural resource allocation is for a “ social or welfare purpose ” . xxmaj on the other hand if the natural resource allocation is “ for commercial pursuits of profit maximising private entrepreneurs ” de hors any social or welfare purpose , then judicial review would be permissible and xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution would be attracted and if the executive action is found to be arbitrary , it would be struck down . xxmaj therefore , when it comes to natural resource allocation , the executive has a somewhat limited elbow room . \n",
       "  70 . xxmaj in his concurring opinion , xxmaj justice xxmaj khehar took the view ( in paragraph 186 of the xxmaj report ) that : “ … when natural resources are made available by the xxmaj state to private persons for commercial exploitation exclusively for their individual gains , the xxmaj state 's endeavour must be towards maximisation of revenue returns . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] xxmaj the learned judge concluded his opinion by agreeing that an auction is one of the price recovery mechanisms , but not the only one for allocation of natural resources . “ xxmaj that should not be understood to mean that it can never be a valid method for disposal of natural resources . ” xxmaj it was further held that natural resources can not be alienated by way of largesse – there must be a reciprocal xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 47 of 101 consideration either in the form of earning revenue or sub - serving the common good or both . xxmaj the learned judge had this to say : \n",
       "  71 . xxmaj this issue was considered in xxmaj goa xxmaj foundation as well . xxmaj the xxmaj court adverted to xxmaj natural xxmaj resources xxmaj allocation in paragraph 81 of the xxmaj report and pithily expressed its view that the manner of granting a mining lease is a policy decision of the xxmaj state xxmaj government , but the decision can be examined by way of judicial review . xxmaj it was held : \n",
       "  xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 48 of 101 “ xxmaj we are of the considered opinion that it is for the xxmaj state xxmaj government to decide as a matter of policy in what manner the leases of these mineral resources would be granted , but this decision has to be taken in accordance with the provisions of the xxup mmdr xxmaj act and the xxmaj rules made thereunder and in consonance with the constitutional provisions and the decision taken by the xxmaj state of xxmaj goa to grant a mining lease in a particular manner or to a particular party can be examined by way of judicial review by the xxmaj court . ” [ xxmaj emphasis supplied by us ] . \n",
       "  xxmaj it was then declared in paragraph 87.5 of the xxmaj report that : \n",
       " \n",
       "  xxmaj similarly , in xxmaj manohar xxmaj lal xxmaj sharma this xxmaj court adverted to the issue and noted the following in paragraph 98 of the xxmaj report : \n",
       " \n",
       "  74 . xxmaj till fairly recently , policy matters particularly of economic policy were hands - off as far as the courts were xxunk xxmaj but the recent decisions of this xxmaj court , including by the xxmaj constitution xxmaj bench in its advisory jurisdiction , have partially modified this theory and kept open the window to judicially review such a policy if it does not serve the common good as understood in xxmaj article 39(b ) of the xxmaj constitution , if it violates xxmaj article 14 of the xxmaj constitution and xxunk natural resources for maximizing profits of private entrepreneurs while xxunk xxmaj article 39(b ) of the xxmaj constitution . “ xxmaj the legislature and the executive are answerable to the xxmaj constitution and it is there where the judiciary , the guardian of the xxmaj constitution , must find the contours to the powers of disposal of natural resources , especially xxmaj article 14 and xxmaj article 39(b ) [ of the xxmaj xxunk \n",
       "  75 . xxmaj notwithstanding this , a xxmaj court must exercise restraint and not set aside xxmaj government policy only because it disagrees with it or because a better policy could be framed or simply because it has the power to set aside the policy . xxmaj policies framed by the xxmaj state , after due consideration , must be 24 xxup balco xxmaj employees ’ xxmaj union ( xxmaj regd ) v. xxmaj union of xxmaj india , ( 2002 ) 2 xxup scc 333 at paragraphs 46 and 47 25 xxmaj paragraph 95 of the xxmaj natural xxmaj resource xxmaj allocation decision xxup s.l.p. ( c ) xxmaj no . 32138 of 2015 etc . xxmaj page 52 of 101 respected and given enough elbow room and flexibility for implementation . xxmaj of course , there would be occasions when the implementation of a policy has teething problems or some lacuna is discovered at a slightly later stage , but that does not mean that policy itself is defective . xxmaj therefore , xxmaj courts must be very cautious and circumspect in diluting or setting aside a policy and must do so only if it is constitutionally unavoidable , otherwise good governance could be a casualty . \n",
       " \n",
       "  76 . xxmaj the conclusions that could be drawn from all these decisions are : ( i ) xxmaj it is not obligatory , constitutionally or otherwise , that a natural resource ( other than spectrum ) must be disposed of or alienated or allocated only through an auction or through competitive bidding ; ( ii ) xxmaj where xxeos\n",
